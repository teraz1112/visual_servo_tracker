This project refactors internal research code and includes optional support for third-party frameworks.
No external source repositories are bundled at this moment.

If third-party code is added later:
- Keep each upstream LICENSE in `third_party/<name>/`.
- Record source URL and commit hash in `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`.
